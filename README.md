# Taming CSS

<img src="logo.png"/>

 This is a book taking a comprehensive look at how to write and maintain CSS.  It is written primarily for web developers, but I start with the basics so anybody should be able to pick up and follow along.  For more on why I am writing it and what sets it apart from other CSS books out there, I invite you to read the [Introduction](introduction.md).

## Publishing

For now, I am releasing these books here as drafts, free to read.  I would like to eventually publish them, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

## Contributing

Use [the issues page](https://github.com/keithjgrant/Taming-CSS/issues) to give feedback or find ways to help.

Any contributions you would like to make are certainly welcome.  I welcome help editing, correcting typos, or making improvements to the examples.

If you have content to contribute, you may, though note that in doing so, you are giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content should I publish these books.  Also know that I may edit or rephase it as necessary to fit the voice of the rest of the book.  My overall outline is also subject to change as the project continues, especially in these earlier stages... so, your contribution may be moved, split into separate sections, or even altogether cut.  Regardless, I will certainly mention you by name in the thank-yous!
